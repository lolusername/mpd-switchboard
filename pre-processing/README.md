# Pre-Processing and Exploration of PDF Document Dataset

## Overview

As part of building a **data dashboard app** for a nonprofit organization, this phase involves **pre-processing** and **exploring** a collection of PDF documents. This step is crucial because it helps us understand the structure and size of the documents in the dataset, allowing us to manage them more efficiently in the app.

The pre-processing work ensures that we can **organize**, **upload**, and **store** these documents in a way that makes them easily accessible and usable by the nonprofit team and stakeholders. By analyzing the dataset now, we avoid potential technical challenges later, ensuring the app runs smoothly and cost-effectively.

## Why Pre-Processing Matters

When dealing with large numbers of documents, such as **reports**, **case studies**, or **legal files**, it is important to understand their size and structure. This helps us:

- **Store documents efficiently**: Cloud storage providers, like **AWS**, often have different storage tiers. By understanding the size of the files, we can make better decisions about which storage options to choose, keeping costs down without sacrificing performance.
  
- **Ensure quick access**: Knowing the size of the documents means we can ensure that the data dashboard allows users to **quickly retrieve** and view the files, without long delays.

- **Prepare for future scalability**: As the nonprofit organization grows, the number of documents will likely increase. Pre-processing ensures the system can handle larger datasets in the future.

## What Does Pre-Processing Involve?

In this phase, we focus on the following key tasks:

1. **Analyzing File Sizes**:
   - We calculate the size of each PDF document in **megabytes (MB)**. This helps us understand how much storage space is required and whether there are any particularly large files that might require special attention.
   
2. **Visualizing the Data**:
   - We create **charts** that show the distribution of file sizes. This allows us to easily see how many small, medium, or large files exist in the dataset.
   
   - We use both **linear** and **logarithmic** charts to show this. The linear chart provides a straightforward view, while the logarithmic chart helps us understand how a few very large files compare to the rest of the dataset.
   
3. **Generating a Summary Report**:
   - We generate a **PDF report** that summarizes the dataset. This report includes:
     - The **total number of files**.
     - The **total size of all the files** combined.
     - The **smallest** and **largest** file sizes.
     - The **median** (middle value) file size, which gives us a sense of what a typical document looks like.
     - The **charts** showing the distribution of file sizes.
   - This report can be shared with team members and stakeholders to give them an overview of the dataset.

## How Does This Help Our Nonprofit?

Pre-processing and data exploration help nonprofits by ensuring that their digital assets are managed efficiently. Here’s how:

1. **Cost Management**: By knowing how large the files are, we can make informed decisions about where and how to store them, saving on storage costs while ensuring the files are readily available.

2. **Improved Performance**: Pre-processing ensures that the files load quickly in the data dashboard, enhancing the user experience. Quick access to reports and documents can save time and make the team more productive.

3. **Future-Proofing**: As your organization grows and the number of documents increases, this pre-processing ensures that the system remains efficient and scalable. It helps avoid potential technical issues down the line, keeping the system running smoothly.

## Summary of the Process

1. **Collect**: We first collect all the PDFs from your document archive and prepare them for analysis.
   
2. **Analyze**: We analyze each document’s size, creating a full picture of the dataset’s structure.

3. **Visualize**: We produce charts that show how the document sizes are distributed, helping us see if there are any unusual files or patterns.

4. **Report**: Finally, we generate a report that summarizes all of this information, giving both the technical team and the nonprofit’s leadership an overview of what the dataset looks like.

## Conclusion

Pre-processing and exploring the dataset is a vital step in preparing for the data dashboard app. It ensures that the system is built on a solid foundation, with careful attention to storage efficiency, accessibility, and scalability. By taking the time to analyze the dataset now, we are ensuring a smoother, faster, and more cost-effective platform for managing your organization’s documents, allowing you to focus on your mission.
